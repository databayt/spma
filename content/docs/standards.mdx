### PMBOK Guide

- **Tailoring** — Guidance on adapting approaches to fit project context
- **Models, Methods, and Artifacts** — Tools and techniques for effective project delivery

### The Standard for Program Management

Guidance for managing programs — groups of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.

### The Standard for Portfolio Management

Framework for aligning project and program investments with organizational strategy to maximize value delivery.
